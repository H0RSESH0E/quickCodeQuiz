## Description
  This application began as an assignment for a course and became a passion project that nearly killed me - well, actually, I just tried to make it much more than it needed to be and I got behind on my work and skipped dinner one night because I was working on it.

The following is a short description of my experience completing the project:

- I woke up inspired with an idea for driving my quiz application with simple inputs like the old arcade consoles from back in the day.
- I realized I could create my own object and simply push and pull my way through the data I stored there and I could structure it so that I could used the architecture for any game - just like the shells of the old arcade games.  It was going to be a thing of beauty - an homage to Pong and all the old tech.  I had my own Jodorowsky's Dune style experience instead - well, not quite that bad.  I did submit this afterall.
- The most significant learning I did was that some time saving structures can become overly labourious to realize -- there is a happy medium.

## Credits
This is my fourth project in the Coding Boot Camp provided by [The School of Continuing Studies, University of Toronto](https://learn.utoronto.ca/) and [Trilogy Education Services](https://www.trilogyed.com/). I was inspired by the art from Joust the video game and use it in a significantly modified form in the website.

## Features
CRUD is difficult to describe, but it's better than it sounds.  It has two buttons and a warm green glow.  But don't let me spoil it for you.  You've got to try CRUD for yourself.
